"""ROS/CARLA-free logic for publishing CARLA traffic-light states to Autoware.

See docs/CARLA_Autoware_信号状態publish_実装計画_v1.0.md (T3). Upstream keeps this logic
inside ``carla_ros.py``; it is split out here so the group-id resolution order, the
per-group aggregation and the state conversion can be unit-tested without ROS or CARLA.
The geometric matching itself lives in ``traffic_light_matcher.py`` (ported unchanged
from upstream).

Inputs are plain values (CARLA states by name, positions as tuples), so the caller in
``carla_ros.py`` only has to read the CARLA actors and build the ROS message.
